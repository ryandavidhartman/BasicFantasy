
Magic Mouth
Range: 30'

Magic User 1

Duration: special

This spell imbues the chosen non-living object with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs. The message, which may be up to three words per caster level long, can be in any language known by the caster and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes, at any volume from a whisper to a yell. The voice will resemble the caster's, but will not be identical. The mouth cannot use command words or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object.

The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to the caster's command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish level, hit dice, or class except by external garb.

The range limit of a trigger is 10 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 60 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.

Massmorph
Range: 100'+10'/level

Magic User 4

Duration: 1 hour/level

With this spell the caster causes 1d4+1 man-sized (or smaller) creatures per four caster levels to appear as if they are natural effects of the terrain (for example, trees in a forest, stalagmites in a cave, coral underwater, boulders in a cavern, etc.). All creatures to be affected must be within a 120' radius of the caster at the time the spell is cast. Only those creatures the caster wishes to hide are affected, and then only if they are willing to be concealed. The caster may include himself or herself among the affected creatures.

Those affected are thus concealed from other creatures passing through the area for so long as they remain still. If an affected creature chooses to move or attack, the illusion is dispelled for that creature, but those who remain still continue to be hidden. The caster may end the spell early if he or she wishes by speaking a single word. The illusion can also be ended by dispel magic.

Mirror Image
Range: self

Magic User 2

Duration: 1 turn/level

This spell creates several illusory duplicates of the caster. The images move through each other as well as the real caster more or less constantly, making it impossible for most creatures to determine which is real. A total of 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total) are created. These figments separate from the caster and remain in a cluster around him or her. The figments mimic the caster's actions, pretending to cast spells, drink potions, levitate, and so on, just as the caster does. Figments always look exactly like the caster.

Enemies attempting to attack or cast spells upon the caster will always hit a figment instead. Any attack against an image destroys it, whether the attack roll is successful or not; likewise, attack spells cast directly upon a figment will destroy it, with no saving throw allowed. Area-effect spells are not cast directly on the caster, and thus appear to affect all figments exactly as they affect the caster; for instance, if the caster is subjected to a fireball, all figments will appear to be injured just as the caster was.

Neutralize Poison*
Range: touch

Cleric 4

Duration: instantaneous

This spell detoxifies any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. A poisoned creature suffers no additional effects from the poison; if cast upon a creature slain by poison in the last 10 rounds, the creature is revived with 1 hit point. If cast upon a poisonous object (weapon, trap, etc.) the poison is rendered permanently ineffective.

Reversed, this spell becomes poison. The caster must make a successful attack roll; if the attack is a success, the target must save vs. Poison or die. The caster's touch remains poisonous for 1 round per level of ability, or until discharged (i.e. only one creature can be affected by the reversed spell).

Passwall
Range: 30'

Magic User 5

Duration: 3 turns

Passwall creates a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or other harder materials. The passage is up to 10 feet deep plus an additional 10 feet deep per three caster levels above 9th (20 feet at 12th, 30 feet deep at 15th, 40 feet deep at 18th). If the wall’s thickness is more than the depth of the passage created, then a single passwall simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several passwall spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When passwall ends (due to duration, dispel magic, or caster's choice), creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit.

Phantasmal Force
Range: 180'

Magic User 2

Duration: concentration

This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature (or small group of creatures), or other effect, as visualized by the caster up to a maximum size of 20'x20'x20'. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature. The caster can animate the image within the limits of the area of effect. The image persists so long as the caster concentrates upon it.

If used to create the illusion of one or more creatures, they will have an Armor Class of 11 and will disappear if hit in combat. Damage done by monsters, spells, etc. simulated by this spell is not real; those “killed” or otherwise apparently disabled will wake up uninjured (at least from this spell) after 2d8 rounds. The illusory damage done will be equivalent to the normal damage for any attack form simulated.

Attempting to animate more creatures than the caster's level grants viewing creatures with at least average Intelligence an immediate save vs. Spells to recognize the creatures as illusions; those making the save will be unaffected by any actions taken by the illusions from that point on. A similar save may be granted by the GM any time he or she feels the illusion is likely to be seen through, especially if the player describes an illusion which seems improbable or otherwise poorly conceived.

Polymorph Other
Range: 30'

Magic User 4

Duration: permanent

This spell allows the caster to change one target into another form of living creature. The assumed form can’t have more hit dice than caster’s level, or be incorporeal or gaseous. Unlike polymorph self, the transformed target also gains the behavioral and mental traits, any physical attacks, special, supernatural or spell-like abilities of the new form, in addition to the physical capabilities and statistics of such. If the new form is substantially less intelligent, the target may not remember its former life.

The target creature will have the same number of hit points it previously had, regardless of the hit dice of the form assumed. Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to this spell, as noted above. A creature with shape changing abilities such as a doppleganger can revert to its natural form in one round.

Unwilling targets that successfully save against Polymorph are not affected. The spell is permanent until dispelled or the creature is slain, at which time the target reverts to his or her original form.

Polymorph Self
Range: self

Magic User 4

Duration: 1 hour/level

This spell allows the caster to change into another form of living creature. The assumed form can’t have more hit dice than the caster's level. The caster can’t assume an incorporeal or gaseous form. If slain, the caster reverts to his or her original form.

The caster gains the physical capabilities and statistics of the new form but retains his or her own mental abilities. He or she also gains all physical attacks possessed by the form but does not gain any special, supernatural or spell-like abilities. Dragon breath is a special ability, for instance, so were the caster to assume the form of a dragon he or she could use the dragon's normal claw, bite, and tail swipe attacks, but not the dragon's breath.

The caster can remain transformed up to one hour per level of ability, or may choose to end the spell whenever he or she desires (up to one hour per level, of course).

Projected Image
Range: 240'

Magic User 6

Duration: 6 turns

This spell creates a quasi-real, illusory version of the caster. The intangible projected image looks, sounds, and smells like the caster, in addition to mimicking gestures and actions (including speech). Any further spells cast seem to originate from the illusion, not the actual caster. A line of sight between the caster and his or her illusory self must be maintained or the spell ends. Dimension door, teleport, or any similar spell that breaks the line of sight dispels the image, as does the illusionary caster being struck in combat. Note that this spell grants no special sensory powers to the caster; for example, if the illusory self is positioned so as to be able to see something the caster can't directly see, the caster does not see it. Also, all spell ranges are still figured from the caster's actual position, not the illusory self's position.

Protection from Evil*
Cleric 1, Magic-User 1

Range: touch

Duration: 1 turn/level

This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.

First, the subject gains a +2 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Note that the definition of “evil” is left to the individual GM to decide.

Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including charm spells or effects). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting control does, the would-be controller would then be able to command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast.

Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures (regardless of whether they are “evil” or not). This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.

Reversed, this spell becomes protection from good. It functions in all ways as described above, save that “good” creatures are kept away, rather than “evil” creatures.

Protection from Evil 10' Radius*
Cleric 4, Magic-User 3

Range: touch

Duration: 1 turn/level

This spell functions exactly as protection from evil, but with a 10' radius rather than a 1' radius. All within the radius receive the protection; those who leave and then re-enter, or who enter after the spell is cast, receive the protection as well.

Reversed, this spell becomes protection from good 10' radius, and functions exactly as the reversed form of protection from evil, except that it covers a 10' radius around the target rather than the normal 1' radius.

Protection from Normal Missiles
Magic User 3

Range: self

Duration: 1 turn/level

The caster is completely protected from small sized, non-magical missile attacks. Therefore, magic arrows, hurled boulders, or other such are not blocked, but any number of normal arrows, sling bullets, crossbow bolts, thrown daggers, etc. will be fended off. Note that normal missiles projected by magic bows count as magical missiles for the purposes of this spell.

Purify Food and Water
Cleric 1

Range: 10'

Duration: instantaneous

This spell makes spoiled, rotten, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated food and water pure and suitable for eating and drinking. This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay or spoilage. Unholy water and similar food and drink of significance is spoiled by purify food and drink, but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type nor upon magic potions.

Quest*
Range: 5'/level

Cleric 5

Duration: special

Quest places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by the caster. The target creature must be able to understand the caster for this spell to take effect. While a quest cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.

A saving throw vs. Spells will allow an unwilling target to resist a quest when it is first cast. However, the target may choose to accept the quest, typically as part of a bargain with the caster to perform some service.

The affected creature must follow the given instructions until the quest is completed, no matter how long it takes.

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.

If the subject is prevented from obeying the quest for 24 hours, it takes 3d6 points of damage each day.

A quest (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a remove curse spell from a caster two or more levels higher than the caster of the quest, or by a wish, or by the reverse of this spell. Dispel magic does not affect a quest spell.

Raise Dead*
Range: touch

Cleric 5

Duration: instantaneous

This spell restores life to a deceased human, demi-human or humanoid. The caster can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than one day per caster level. In addition, the subject’s soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell loses one level (or 1 hit die) when it is raised, permanently (i.e. it does not accrue a negative level, but rather loses an actual level, being reduced to the minimum number of experience points required for the previous level). If the subject is 1st level, it loses 1 point of Constitution instead (if this would reduce its Constitution to 0 or less, it can’t be raised). This level, hit dice, or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means, though of course the character may gain levels and hit dice in the normal fashion.

Also note, a character who died with spells prepared has none prepared upon being raised.

A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current hit dice. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature’s equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell.

A creature which has become undead can’t be raised by this spell. Constructs and elementals cannot be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.

The reverse of this spell, slay living, will kill instantly the creature touched (which may be of any sort, not just a human, demi-human or humanoid) unless a save vs. Spells is made. If the saving throw is successful, 2d6 damage is dealt to the victim instead. An attack roll is required to apply this spell in combat.

Read Languages
Range: 0

Magic User 1

Duration: special

This spell grants the caster the ability to read almost any written language. It may be cast in one of three modes:

In the first mode, the spell allows the caster to read any number of written works in a variety of languages. This mode lasts for 1 turn per caster level.

In the second mode, the spell allows the caster to read any one book or tome; this mode lasts 3 hours per caster level.

In the third mode, the spell allows the caster to read any one non-magical scroll or other single-sheet document; this mode is permanent.

This spell does not work on any sort of magical text, such as spell scrolls or spellbooks; see read magic, below, for the correct spell to use in such cases.

The spell grants the ability to read the texts, but does not in any way hasten the reading nor grant understanding of concepts the caster doesn't otherwise have the ability to understand. Also, for this spell to function, there must be at least one living creature that can read the given language somewhere on the same plane. The knowledge is not copied from that creature's mind; rather, it is the existence of the knowledge that enables the spell to function.

Read Magic
Range: 0

Magic User 1

Duration: permanent

When cast upon any magical text, such as a spellbook or magic-user spell scroll, this spell enables the caster to read that text. Casting this spell on a cursed text will generally trigger the curse. All Magic-Users begin play knowing this spell, and it can be prepared even if the Magic-User loses access to his or her spellbook.

Regenerate
Range: touch

Cleric 6

Duration: permanent

This spell causes the subject’s severed body members (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or even heads of multiheaded creatures), broken bones, and ruined organs to grow back. After the spell is cast, the physical regeneration is complete in 1 round if the severed members are present and touching the creature. Otherwise, a full turn is required for the regeneration to complete.

This spell also heals 3d8 points of damage. Regenerate has no effect on nonliving creatures or constructs (including undead).

Reincarnate
Range: touch

Magic User 6

Duration: instantaneous

With this spell, the caster brings back a dead character (or humanoid creature) in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than one week before the casting of the spell and the subject’s soul is free and willing to return. If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work.

Roll on the following table to determine what sort of creature the character becomes:

d%	Incarnation
01–02	Bugbear
03–17	Dwarf
18–28	Elf
29	Gnoll
30–39	Gnome
40–44	Goblin
45–63	Halfling
64–88	Human
89–92	Kobold
93	Lizard Man
94–98	Orc
99	Troglodyte
100	Other (GM's choice)
Since the dead character is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the character’s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the character’s body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes one hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.

A reincarnated character recalls the majority of its former life and form. Its class is unchanged, as are the character's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores should be rerolled. (If the character's ability scores are outside the allowable range for the new form, they should be adjusted up or down by the GM as needed.) The subject’s level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1; this is a real reduction, not a negative level, and is not subject to magical restoration. Roll one hit die and subtract the total from the character's original hit point total; this is the new form's hit points. If the subject was 1st level, instead of a hit point reduction, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2.

A character that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can’t be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, and undead creatures can’t be reincarnated. The spell cannot bring back a creature who has died of old age.

The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn’t automatically speak the language of the new form.

Remove Curse*
Range: 30'

Cleric 3, Magic-User 4

Duration: instantaneous

Remove curse instantaneously removes all curses on an object or a creature. Remove curse does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although the spell typically enables the creature afflicted with any such cursed item to remove and get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell or may be removed only by a caster of a certain level.

The reverse of this spell, bestow curse, allows the caster to place a curse on the subject. A save vs. Spells is allowed to resist. The caster must choose one of the following three effects:

–4 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1).

–4 penalty on attack rolls and saves.

Each round of combat, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action.

The caster may also invent his or her own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The curse thus bestowed cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a remove curse spell.

Remove Fear*
Range: touch (120')

Cleric 1

Duration: instantaneous

(2 turns)

This spell will calm the creature touched. If the target creature is currently subject to any sort of magical fear, it is allowed a new save vs. Spells to resist that fear, at a bonus of +1 per level of the caster.

The reverse of this spell, cause fear, causes one target creature within 120' to become frightened; if the target fails to save vs. Spells, it flees for 2 turns. Creatures with 6 or more hit dice are immune to this effect.

Resist Cold
Range: touch

Cleric 1

Duration: 1 round/level

This abjuration grants a creature temporary immunity to cold. Minor cold (such as exposure to winter weather in inadequate clothing) is ignored by the affected creature. Against more significant cold (such as the breath of a White Dragon), the affected creature gains a bonus of +3 on saving throws, and all damage from such attacks is reduced by half (round up).

Resist Fire
Range: touch

Cleric 2

Duration: 1 round/level

This abjuration grants a creature temporary immunity to fire and heat. Minor heat or fire (such as exposure to normal flames) is ignored by the affected creature. Against more significant heat or fire (such as a fireball), the affected creature gains a bonus of +3 on saving throws, and all damage from such attacks is reduced by half (round up).

Restoration
Range: touch

Cleric 6

Duration: permanent

Each casting of the spell removes a single negative level from a creature who has suffered energy drain. At 16th level, two negative levels may be removed. See the rules for Energy Drain (in the Encounter section) for more details.

Alternately, this spell can be used to restore drained ability score points. If applied to a character who has suffered temporary loss of ability points, it will restore up to 1d4 lost points to any one drained ability immediately. If applied to a character who has suffered permanent loss of ability points, 1 point can be restored.

Restoration does not restore levels lost due to death (as described for the spell raise dead).

Shield
Range: self

Magic User 1

Duration: 5 rounds+1/level

Shield creates an invisible, shield-like mobile disk of force that hovers in front of the caster. It negates magic missile attacks directed at the caster, and improves the caster's Armor Class by +3 vs. melee attacks and +6 vs. missile weapons. The Armor Class benefits do not apply to attacks originating from behind the caster, but magic missiles are warded off from all directions.

Silence 15' Radius
Cleric 2

Range: 360'

Duration: 2 rounds/level

Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails within a 15' radius around the target. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, making the effect stationary, or it may be cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature receives a save vs. Spells to negate the spell. If an item in another creature’s possession is targeted, that creature also receives a save vs. Spells to negate. This spell provides a defense against sonic or language-based attacks or spells.

Sleep
Range: 90'

Magic User 1

Duration: 5 rounds/level

This spell puts several creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice into a magical slumber. Creatures of 4 or more hit dice are not affected. The caster chooses a point of origin for the spell (within the given range, of course), and those creatures within 30' of the chosen point may be affected. Each creature in the area of effect is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist the effect.

Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Sleep does not affect unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures, and such creatures in the area of effect are ignored.

When the duration elapses, the sleeping creatures normally wake up immediately; however, if they are made very comfortable and the surroundings are quiet, the affected creatures may continue sleeping normally, at the GM's option.

Speak with Animals
Cleric 2

Range: special

Duration: 1 turn/4 levels

The caster can comprehend and communicate with any one animal (normal or giant sized, but not magical or monstrous) that is in sight of the caster and able to hear him or her. The caster may change which animal he or she is speaking with at will, once per round. The spell doesn’t alter the animal’s reaction or attitude towards the caster; a standard reaction roll should be made to determine this. Furthermore, more intelligent animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones make inane comments. However, if an animal is friendly toward the caster, it may be willing to grant some favor or service.

Speak with Monsters
Cleric 6

Range: special

Duration: 1 turn/5 levels

The caster can comprehend and communicate with any one monster that is in sight of the caster and able to hear him or her. The caster may change which monster he or she is speaking with at will, once per round. Others able to understand the language spoken by the target monster (if any) will be able to understand the caster. The spell doesn’t alter the monster’s reaction or attitude towards the caster. Furthermore, more intelligent monsters are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones make inane comments. If a monster is friendly toward the caster, it may decide to do some favor or service for him or her. Mindless monsters, plant creatures and undead are unaffected by this spell.

Speak with Plants
Range: 20'

Cleric 4

Duration: 1 turn

The caster can comprehend and communicate with both normal plants and plant creatures. A normal plant’s sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won’t be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity. The spell doesn’t alter the plant’s reaction or attitude towards the caster; however, normal plants will generally communicate freely with the caster, as they have nothing else of importance to do. Intelligent plant creatures are more likely to be terse and evasive, behaving in much the same fashion as any other monster. If a plant creature is friendly toward the caster, it may decide to do some favor or service for him or her. Normal plants are usually not animate, and thus cannot generally perform “services” other than to answer questions.

Speak with Dead
Range: 10'

Cleric 3

Duration: 3 rounds/level

This spell grants the semblance of life and intellect to a corpse, allowing it to answer several questions that the caster puts to it. The caster may ask one question per two caster levels. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires. The corpse’s knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers are often brief, cryptic, or repetitive.

If the corpse has been subject to speak with dead within the past week, the new spell fails. The caster can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at all.

This spell does not let the caster actually speak to the person (whose soul has departed). It instead draws on the imprinted knowledge “stored” in the corpse. The partially animated body retains the imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had while alive. The corpse, however, cannot learn new information. Indeed, it can’t even remember being questioned.

This spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.

Spiritual Hammer
Range: 30'

Cleric 2

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell causes a warhammer made of pure force to spring into existence, attacking any foe chosen by the Cleric within range once per round. It deals 1d6 hit points of damage per strike, +1 point per three caster levels (maximum of +5). It uses the caster’s normal attack bonus, striking as a magical weapon, and thus can inflict damage upon creatures that are only hit by magic weapons. If the hammer goes beyond the spell range, the Cleric loses sight of it, or the caster ceases to direct it, the hammer disappears. The hammer cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, or a rod of cancellation will dispel it.

Sticks to Snakes
Range: 120'

Cleric 4

Duration: 6 turns

This spell transforms normal wooden sticks into 1d4 hit dice worth of normal (not giant) snakes per every four caster levels. (See the Monsters section for details on types of snakes.) The snakes follow the commands of the caster. When slain, dispelled, or the spell expires, the snakes return to their original stick form. Magical “sticks” such as enchanted staves cannot be affected.

Striking
Range: touch

Cleric 3

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell bestows upon one weapon the ability to deal 1d6 points of additional damage. This extra damage is applied on each successful attack for the duration of the spell. It provides no attack bonus, but if cast on a normal weapon, the spell allows monsters only hit by magical weapons to be affected; only the 1d6 points of magical damage applies to such a monster, however.

Telekinesis
Range: self

Magic User 5

Duration: 3 turns

This spell permits the caster to move objects or creatures by concentration alone. An object weighing no more than 50 pounds per caster level can be moved up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on itself or an object it holds or has on its body with a successful save vs. Death Ray. In order to use this power, the caster must maintain concentration, moving no more than normal movement (no running), making no attacks and casting no spells. If concentration is lost (whether intentional or not), the power may be used again on the next round, but the subject of the effect is allowed a new saving throw.

Teleport
Range: self

Magic User 5

Duration: instantaneous

This spell instantly transports the caster to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. The caster can bring along objects or creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100 pounds per level above 10th. The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at least one of those creatures in contact with the caster). Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist the spell, and the caster may need to make an attack roll to make contact with such a creature. Likewise, a successful save vs. Spells will prevent items in a creature's possession from being teleported.

The caster must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer the mental image, the more likely it is that the teleportation will work. Areas of strong magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.

To determine the results of this spell, roll d% and consult the table below. Below the table is an explanation of the terms used.

Familiarity	On Target	Off Target	Similar Area	Mishap
Very familiar	01–97	98–99	100	—
Studied carefully	01–94	95–97	98–99	100
Seen casually	01–88	89–94	95–98	99–100
Viewed once	01–76	77–88	89–96	97–100
False destination	—	—	81–92	93–100
Familiarity: “Very familiar” is a place where the caster has been very often and feels at home. “Studied carefully” is a place the caster knows well, either because it can currently be seen, the caster has been there often, or other means (such as scrying) have been used to study the place for at least one hour. “Seen casually” is a place that the caster has seen more than once but with which he or she is not very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place that the caster has seen once, possibly using magic.

“False destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if the caster is teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar. When rolling on this row, use 1d20+80.

On Target: The caster appears exactly where desired.

Off Target: The caster appears safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.

Similar Area: The caster winds up in an area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. This means that the caster appears in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell’s range, the spell simply fails instead.

Mishap: The caster and anyone else teleporting with the caster have gotten “scrambled.” Each takes 1d10 points of damage; then reroll on the chart to see where they wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “Mishap” comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.

True Seeing
Range: touch

Cleric 5

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell confers on the target the ability to see all things as they actually are. The subject sees through normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors, sees the exact locations of displaced creatures or objects, sees through normal or magical disguises, sees invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. The range of true seeing conferred is 120 feet.

True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use true seeing through a crystal ball or in conjunction with clairvoyance.

Ventriloquism
Range: 60'

Magic User 1

Duration: 1 turn/level

This spell allows the caster to cause his or her voice to sound from someplace else within range, for example, from a dark alcove or statue.

Wall of Fire
Range: 180'

Cleric 5, Magic-User 4

Duration: 1 round/level

(or special)

An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those beyond 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and on the caster's turn each round to all creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points +1 point per caster level of fire damage to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures.

The wall is either a sheet of flame up to 20' in length per caster level, or a ring with a radius up to 5' per caster level. The caster may choose to make the wall smaller if desired. The wall may be up to 20' tall (as desired by the caster and/or constrained by the ceiling).

If the caster evokes the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall; a save vs. Spells is allowed, with success indicating that damage is rolled as if the creature is within 10' of the wall.

The caster may choose to maintain the spell indefinitely (within reasonable limits of endurance) by concentration, or may cast it with the standard duration of 1 round per level, at his or her option.

Wall of Iron
Range: 90'

Magic User 6

Duration: permanent

This spell causes a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. The wall is composed of up to one 10'x10' square section, one inch thick, per caster level. If the caster so desires, the wall can bond itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The wall must always be a flat plane, though the edges can be shaped to fit the available space, and it must always be conjured in contact with the ground.

The caster can increase the thickness of the wall with a proportionate reduction in the area; for example, doubling the thickness halves the area. The wall may not be made less than one inch thick. The caster can create the wall vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left un-pushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature with 13 Strength (or 4 or more Hit Dice) can push the wall over; or several creatures can work together to do so. (If the optional Ability Roll rule is being used, a Strength roll at -3 is sufficient to topple the wall.) Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful saves vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added). Any creature of Ogre-size or smaller that fails the save takes 10d6 points of damage. The wall cannot crush larger creatures.

Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena.

Wall of Stone
Range: 15' per level

Magic User 5

Duration: permanent

This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. The wall is composed of up to one 10'x10' square section, 1' thick, per caster level. The caster can double the wall’s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.

The caster can create a wall of stone in almost any shape he or she desires. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed, reducing the spell’s area by half. The wall can also be crudely shaped to create crenelations, battlements, and so forth by similarly reducing the area.

Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping.

It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful saves vs. Death Ray.

Water Breathing
Range: touch

Magic User 3

Duration: 2 hours/level

The affected creatures can breathe water freely. Divide the duration evenly among all the creatures the caster touches. The spell does not make creatures unable to breathe air.

Web
Range: 10' per level

Magic User 2

Duration: 2 turns/level

Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands, filling a volume of 8,000 cubic feet (equivalent to eight 10'x10'x10' cubes). The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears; within this limitation, the caster may choose any arrangement of webs he or she wishes, up to the limit of range and the given 8,000 cubic foot volume. The caster may choose to create a smaller volume if he or she wishes. Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won’t cause the attacker to become entangled, but moving through the affected area will.

Anyone in the area of effect when the spell is cast must make a save vs. Death Ray. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is reduced to one-half normal movement rate. Such entangled creatures may not cast spells or perform normal attacks; whether other actions are possible is left to the GM to decide. Once an entangled creature leaves the area of effect of the web, it will be able to act normally again.

If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can’t move or perform any other physical action. Speech remains possible, however. Creatures with Strength of 13 or higher (or 4 or more hit dice) may be able to break loose, however; each round, such creatures are allowed another save vs. Death Ray with results as given above. Creatures failing the initial save and having Strength of 12 or less (or fewer than 4 hit dice) are trapped until the duration expires or the webs are otherwise removed.

The strands of a web spell are flammable. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away a 10' cube in 1 round; the fire will spread to adjacent 10' cubes each round until all the webbing is consumed (or the fire is put out by some means). All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames, but if they survive they are completely free afterwards.

Wizard Eye
Range: 240'

Magic User 4

Duration: 6 turns

With this spell the caster creates an invisible magical “eye” through which he or she can see. The eye has Darkvision, but otherwise sees exactly as the caster would. It can be created in any place the caster can see, up to a range of 240' away, and thereafter can move at a rate of 40' per round as directed by the caster. The eye will not move more than 240' feet away from the caster under any circumstances. The eye cannot pass through solid objects, but as it is exactly the size of a normal human's eye, it can pass through holes as small as 1 inch in diameter. The caster must concentrate to use the eye.

Wizard Lock
Range: 20'

Magic User 2

Duration: permanent

A wizard lock spell cast upon a door, chest, or portal magically locks it. The caster can freely pass his or her own wizard lock without affecting it, as can any Magic-User 3 or more levels higher than the caster of the wizard lock; otherwise, a door or object secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful dispel magic or knock spell.

Word of Recall
Range: self (special)

Cleric 6

Duration: instantaneous

Word of recall teleports the caster instantly back to his or her sanctuary when a single word is uttered. The caster must designate the sanctuary when he or she prepares the spell, and it must be a very familiar place. The actual point of arrival is a designated area no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. The caster can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes. The caster can bring along objects or creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100 pounds per level above 10th. The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at least one of those creatures in contact with the caster).

An unwilling creature can’t be teleported by word of recall. Likewise, a creature’s save vs. Spells prevents items in its possession from being teleported.
